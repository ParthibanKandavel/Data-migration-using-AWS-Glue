# Healthcare Claims Data Migration - AWS Glue to Redshift/Snowflake

## 🧾 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an ETL pipeline that extracts healthcare/claims data from CSV files in Amazon S3, transforms it using AWS Glue, and loads it into Redshift or Snowflake. It includes logging, error handling, and basic monitoring logic.

---

## 🔧 Components
- **AWS S3**: Source storage for raw healthcare claim CSV files.
- **AWS Glue**: Serverless ETL for transformation and loading.
- **AWS Redshift / Snowflake**: Target data warehouse.
- **AWS Lambda (optional)**: Trigger for job orchestration or post-processing.
- **Python Scripts**: Local transformation and schema mapping support.
